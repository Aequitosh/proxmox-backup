Features
--------

:Proxmox VE: The `Proxmox Virtual Environment`_ is fully
   supported. You can backup :term:`virtual machine`\ s and
   :term:`container`\ s.

:GUI: We provide a graphical, web based user interface.

:Deduplication: Inkremental backup produces large amounts of duplicate
   data. The deduplication layer removes that redundancy and makes
   inkremental backup small and space efficient.

:Remote Sync: It is possible to efficently synchronize data to remote
   sites. Only deltas containing new data are transfered.

:Performance: The whole software stack is written in :term:`Rust`,
   which provides high speed and memory efficiency.

:Open Source: No secrets. You have access to the whole source tree.
